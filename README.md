- The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
- Complete web application composed by:
  1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
  2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
  3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
  4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Concepts tested

1. Unittest
2. Python packages
3. *args, **kwargs
4. datetime
5. More

## The console

- create your data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

- The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

- This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

- The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine
